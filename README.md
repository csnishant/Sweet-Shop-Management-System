## My AI Usage

I used **ChatGPT** as an AI assistant during the development of this project.

### AI Tools Used
- ChatGPT

### How I Used AI
- Used ChatGPT to generate initial backend API boilerplate using Node.js and Express.
- Took help in designing REST API endpoints for authentication, sweets management, and inventory operations.
- Used ChatGPT to scaffold React components using Vite and Tailwind CSS.
- Took guidance for folder structure, project organization, and best practices.
- Used AI suggestions to understand test cases and improve code readability.

### Reflection on AI Usage
Using ChatGPT significantly improved my development speed and helped me structure the project in a clean and scalable way. It reduced repetitive coding effort and provided clarity while implementing APIs and frontend components. However, all business logic, API integration, testing, and final implementation decisions were reviewed and implemented by me. AI acted as a support tool, not a replacement for understanding the code.
